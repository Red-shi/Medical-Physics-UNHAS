    <p>Anatomy, circulation, and the mechanics of blood flow.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>The Cardiovascular System (also known as the Circulatory System) is responsible for the rapid transport of blood throughout the body. Its primary components are the Heart (the pump), Blood Vessels (the highways), and Blood (the transport medium).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Heart: The Muscular Pump</h2>
        <img src="fig/Anatomy and Chambers.jpeg"  width="500" height="300"> 
    <div class="section-item">
        <h3>A. Anatomy and Chambers</h3>
        <p>The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ located in the mediastinum (center of the chest) designed to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Atria (Upper Chambers):</b> Receive blood returning to the heart (Right Atrium: deoxygenated blood from the body; Left Atrium: oxygenated blood from the lungs).</li>
            <li><b>Ventricles (Lower Chambers):</b> Pump blood out of the heart (Right Ventricle: to the lungs; Left Ventricle: to the rest of the body). The Left Ventricle wall is the thickest, as it pumps blood the longest distance.</li>
            <li><b>Valves:</b> Ensure unidirectional blood flow and prevent backflow (e.g., Tricuspid, Mitral, Aortic, Pulmonary).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-item">
        <h3>B. Cardiac Cycle and Conduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cardiac Cycle:</b> The complete sequence of events in one heartbeat (Systole: contraction/pumping; Diastole: relaxation/filling).</li>
            <li> The heart generates its own rhythm (autorhythmicity), initiated by the Sinoatrial (SA) Node (the natural pacemaker), which sends an electrical impulse through the atria to the Atrioventricular (AV) Node, down the bundle branches, and into the ventricles.</li>
        </ul><b>Conduction System:</b>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Blood Vessels and Circulation Pathways</h2>
        <img src="fig/Blood Vessels and Circulation Pathways.jpeg"  width="500" height="300"> 
    <div class="section-item">
        <h3>A. Types of Vessels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Arteries:</b> Carry blood away from the heart. They have thick, elastic walls to withstand high pressure. The main artery is the Aorta.</li>
            <li><b>Veins:</b> Carry blood towards the heart. They have thinner walls and contain valves to prevent backflow, especially in the limbs. The main veins are the Vena Cavae.</li>
            <li><b>Capillaries:</b> Microscopic vessels that form a dense network within tissues. This is the sole site of gas and nutrient exchange between blood and body cells.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>The Two Main Circulations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Pulmonary Circulation:</b> Short loop. Deoxygenated blood moves from the Right Ventricle &rarr; Pulmonary Artery &rarr; Lungs (where CO<sub>2</sub> is exchanged for O<sub>2</sub>) &rarr; Pulmonary Vein &rarr; Left Atrium.</li>
            <li><b>2. Systemic Circulation:</b> Long loop. Oxygenated blood moves from the Left Ventricle &rarr; Aorta &rarr; Body Tissues &rarr; Vena Cavae &rarr; Right Atrium. This supplies O<sub>2</sub> and nutrients to the entire body.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Blood Pressure and Hemodynamics</h2>
        <img src="fig/Blood Pressure and Hemodynamics.png"  width="500" height="300"> 
    <h3>A. Blood Pressure (BP)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Definition:</b> The force exerted by blood on the walls of blood vessels. Measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).</li>
        <li><b>Systolic Pressure:</b> The maximum pressure recorded in the arteries during ventricular contraction (Systole).</li>
        <li><b>Diastolic Pressure:</b> The minimum pressure recorded in the arteries during ventricular relaxation (Diastole).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Hemodynamics (The Physics of Flow)</h3>
    <p>Blood flow is governed by the relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance, summarized by a modified version of Ohm's Law:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        Flow = &Delta;P / R
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>&Delta; P}$ (Pressure Gradient):</b> The difference in pressure between two points (e.g., between the aorta and the vena cava). Flow is proportional to this gradient.</li>
        <li><b>R (Resistance): </b>The opposition to flow. The biggest contributor to resistance is the diameter of the blood vessels (controlled by vasoconstriction/vasodilation, proportional to 1/r<sup>4</sup>). Flow is inversely proportional to resistance.</li>
        <li><b>Cardiac Output (CO):</b>The volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute: CO = Heart Rate &times; Stroke Volume.</li>
    </ul>
