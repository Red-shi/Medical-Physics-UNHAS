    <h1>⚖️ The Endocrine & Lymphatic Systems</h1>
    <p>The body's chemical control and immunological defense networks.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>The Endocrine System and the Lymphatic System are two vital body control systems. The Endocrine system provides slow, long-term chemical control, while the Lymphatic system handles fluid balance and is the core of the body's rapid immune defense.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Endocrine System: Chemical Control</h2>

    <div class="system-section">
        <h3>Primary Function: Homeostasis and Regulation</h3>
        <p>The Endocrine System is a collection of glands that produce and secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones travel to target cells or organs to regulate processes such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and stress response.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hormones:</b> Chemical messengers that exert specific effects on target cells by binding to specific receptors.</li>
            <li><b>Target Cells:</b> Cells that possess the specific protein receptors needed to bind and respond to a particular hormone.</li>
            <li><b>Comparison to Nervous System:</b> The Endocrine System's responses are typically slower and longer-lasting than the fast, electrical responses of the Nervous System.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="system-section">
        <h3>Major Endocrine Glands and Hormones</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hypothalamus/Pituitary Gland:</b> The "master control center." The hypothalamus controls the pituitary, which in turn releases hormones that regulate other glands (e.g., Growth Hormone, TSH).</li>
            <li><b>Thyroid Gland:</b> Produces thyroid hormones (T <sub>3</sub> and T <sub>4</sub>), which control the body's metabolic rate.</li>
            <li><b>Pancreas (Islets of Langerhans):</b> Produces Insulin (lowers blood sugar) and Glucagon (raises blood sugar).</li>
            <li><b>Adrenal Glands:</b> Produce Cortisol (stress hormone) and Epinephrine (adrenaline, associated with the sympathetic nervous system).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. The Lymphatic System: Fluid Balance and Defense</h2>

    <div class="system-section">
        <h3>Primary Functions: Immunity and Fluid Management</h3>
        <p>The Lymphatic System is a network of vessels, tissues, and organs that plays a vital role in immunity and maintaining fluid balance in the body.</p>
        
        <h4>Components</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lymph:</b> Fluid derived from interstitial fluid that enters the lymphatic vessels.</li>
            <li><b>Lymphatic Vessels:</b> A one-way network of vessels that carry lymph from peripheral tissues back to the cardiovascular system.</li>
            <li><b>Lymphatic Tissues and Organs:</b> Sites where lymphocytes are produced, mature, and initiate immune responses.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="system-section">
        <h3>Key Lymphatic Organs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lymph Nodes:</b> Small, bean-shaped organs clustered throughout the body (neck, armpits, groin). They filter lymph, trapping and destroying foreign substances like bacteria and cancer cells.</li>
            <li><b>Spleen:</b> The largest lymphatic organ. It filters blood, removes old or defective blood cells (e.g., erythrocytes), and serves as a site for immune responses.</li>
            <li><b>Thymus:</b> Located in the chest, this gland is crucial for the maturation of T-lymphocytes (T-cells), which are central to adaptive immunity.</li>
            <li><b>Tonsils:</b> Lymphatic tissue located in the pharynx, protecting against inhaled or ingested foreign bodies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>Immune Response Connection</h3>
        <p>The Lymphatic System houses the primary immune cells, the Lymphocytes (T and B cells). B cells produce antibodies (Humoral Immunity), while T cells directly attack infected or cancerous cells (Cell-Mediated Immunity). This is the body's highly specific defense mechanism.</p>
