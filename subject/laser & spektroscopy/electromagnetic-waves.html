    <h1>🌌 Electromagnetic Waves and Spectrum</h1>
    <p>The universal energy carriers: oscillating fields traveling through space.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <h2>1. Nature and Properties of EM Waves</h2>

    <p>An Electromagnetic (EM) Wave is a wave that consists of oscillating electric fields (E) and magnetic fields (B) propagating through space. These fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. They are created when an electrically charged particle accelerates.</p>

    <h3>Key Properties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Transverse Wave:</b> The oscillations of the E and B fields are perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Speed in Vacuum:</b> All EM waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum, the speed of light (c).
            <div class="formula">
                c = 2.998 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> m/s
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Wave-Particle Duality:</b> EM waves exhibit both wave-like properties (e.g., diffraction, interference) and particle-like properties (photons), where energy is carried in discrete bundles.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>No Medium Required</b> Unlike sound waves (mechanical waves), EM waves do not require a material medium (like air or water) to travel; they can propagate through the vacuum of space.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. The Relationship Between Wave Properties and Energy</h2>

    <p>The entire EM spectrum is defined by the fundamental relationship linking the speed of light (c), wavelength (&lambda;), and frequency (f), and the relationship linking energy ($E$) and frequency (f):</p>

    <div class="formula">
        c = &lambda;f &quad; and &quad; E = hf
    </div>

    <p>Where $h$ is Planck's constant (6.626 &times; 10<sup>-34</sup> J&middot;s ).</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy is Proportional to Frequency (E &prop; f): Higher frequency waves (like Gamma rays) carry more energy per photon.</li>
            <li>Energy is Inversely Proportional to Wavelength ($E \propto 1/\lambda$): Shorter wavelength waves carry more energy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>

    <p>The Electromagnetic Spectrum is the entire range of EM waves arranged by wavelength, frequency, and energy. It is continuous, with arbitrary boundaries defining the different regions.</p>
    

    <h3>Regions of the Spectrum (from Lowest to Highest Energy)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1. Radio Waves:</b> (Longest &lambda;, Lowest E) Used in communication, broadcasting, and MRI.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>2. Microwaves:</b> Used for heating food, radar, and satellite communication.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>3. Infrared (IR):</b> Associated with heat. Used in thermal imaging and night vision.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>4. Visible Light:</b> The narrow band our eyes can detect (&sim; 400 nm to 700 nm). Essential for vision and spectroscopy.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>5. Ultraviolet (UV):</b> (Higher E) Causes suntans and sunburns. Used in sterilization.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>6. X-rays:</b> (Short &lambda;, High E) Ionizing radiation. Used in medical imaging (radiography, CT) due to their ability to penetrate soft tissues.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>7. Gamma Rays (&gamma;):</b> (Shortest &lambda;, Highest E) Ionizing radiation. Originate from nuclear decay. Used in nuclear medicine (SPECT/PET) and radiation therapy (Linac, Cobalt).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Ionizing vs. Non-Ionizing Radiation</h2>

    <p>The distinction between the two is crucial in radiation safety and medical physics:</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Non-Ionizing Radiation:</b> EM waves that have enough energy to excite electrons or cause molecules to vibrate (heat) but NOT enough energy to completely remove an electron from an atom.
                <br>
                Includes Radio, Microwave, IR, Visible, and low-energy UV.
            </li>
            <li><b>Ionizing Radiation:</b> EM waves that carry sufficient energy to knock an electron completely out of its atom, creating an ion pair. This is the process that causes biological damage (DNA damage).
                <br>
                Includes: High-energy UV, X-rays, and Gamma Rays.
            </li>
        </ul>
