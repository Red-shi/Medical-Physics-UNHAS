    <h2>1. Principles of Laser (Light Amplification)</h2>

    <p>LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers generate highly intense, coherent light based on quantum mechanical principles.</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>Key Characteristics of Laser Light</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Monochromatic:</b> Emits light of only one, very specific wavelength (or color).</li>
            <li><b>Coherent:</b> The light waves are in phase both spatially and temporally.</li>
            <li><b>Directional:</b> The beam is highly collimated (parallel) with minimal divergence.</li>
            <li><b>Intense:</b> The energy is concentrated into a small area.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>A. The Three Fundamental Processes</h3>
    <p>Laser operation requires three key interactions between light (photons) and the material's energy states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1. Absorption:</b> An atom in a low energy state (E<sub>1</sub>) absorbs an incident photon and transitions to a higher energy state (E<sub>2</sub>).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>2. Spontaneous Emission:</b> An atom in E<sub>2</sub> randomly decays back to E<sub>2</sub> and emits a photon in a random direction and phase. This is the mechanism for ordinary light sources.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>3. Stimulated Emission:</b> An excited atom in E<sub>2</sub> is struck by an incident photon with energy equal to E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub>. This interaction forces the atom to immediately decay, emitting a second photon that is identical in direction, wavelength, and phase to the incident photon. This is the amplification step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Necessary Conditions for Lasing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Population Inversion:</b> A condition where there are more atoms in the excited state (E<sub>2</sub>) than in the ground state (E<sub>2</sub>). This is achieved by pumping (adding external energy).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Optical Resonator (Cavity):</b> Two mirrors placed parallel to each other. They reflect the stimulated photons back and forth, building up the intensity and ensuring directionality, until a portion of the light exits through the partially reflective mirror as the laser beam. </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Spectroscopy: Analyzing Light and Matter</h2>

    <p>Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation (light) and matter. It is a powerful analytical tool used to identify and quantify substances based on their unique light absorption, emission, or scattering characteristics.</p>

    <h3>A. Fundamental Principle</h3>
    <p>When matter interacts with photons, energy is transferred, causing atoms or molecules to undergo transitions (e.g., electronic, vibrational, rotational). The energy of the photon (E) must match the energy difference between the two states (&Delta; E) for a transition to occur, based on the Planck-Einstein relation: E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency (f=c/&lambda;).</p>

    <h3>B. Main Types of Spectroscopy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Absorption Spectroscopy:</b> Measures the fraction of incident electromagnetic radiation absorbed by a material over a range of wavelengths.
            <ul>
                <li>Techniques: UV-Vis, Infrared (IR), Atomic Absorption (AAS).</li>
                <li>Application: Identification of chemical bonds and quantification of analyte concentration (related to Beer-Lambert Law).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Emission Spectroscopy:</b> Measures the amount of light emitted by a sample after it has been energized (excited) by heat, electricity, or light.
            <ul>
                <li>Techniques: Fluorescence, Chemiluminescence, Atomic Emission (AES).</li>
                <li>Application: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of elements, as each element has a unique emission spectrum. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Raman Spectroscopy:</b> Measures the inelastic scattering of monochromatic light (usually from a laser). The scattered light contains characteristic frequency shifts (Raman shift) corresponding to molecular vibrations.
            <ul>
                <li>Application: Non-destructive chemical fingerprinting of samples, widely used in pharmaceuticals and materials science.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Medical and Scientific Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Lasers in Medicine:</b> Used for precision surgery (CO <sub>2</sub> laser), eye correction (LASIK using Excimer laser), dermatology (pigment removal), and endoscopy (fiber optics).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Laser in Science:</b> Used for high-speed analysis (e.g., flow cytometry), fundamental research, fusion experiments, and measuring distances (LIDAR).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Spectroscopy in Diagnostics:</b> Used to analyze body fluids (blood, urine) for metabolites, proteins, and toxins; and for molecular imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography, OCT).</li>
