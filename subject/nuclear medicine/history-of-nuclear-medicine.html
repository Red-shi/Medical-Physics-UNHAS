    <h1>☢️ The History of Nuclear Medicine</h1>
    <p>Tracing the development of functional imaging and radiopharmaceutical therapy.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Nuclear Medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances (radiopharmaceuticals) in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Unlike anatomical imaging (like X-rays or CT), Nuclear Medicine provides functional and molecular information by tracing biological processes.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Early Discoveries (Late 19th - Early 20th Century)</h2>

    <p>The field is founded upon fundamental discoveries in radioactivity and atomic physics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1896 (Becquerel):</b> Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity (spontaneous emission of radiation).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1898 (Curie):</b> Marie and Pierre Curie isolated Radium (Ra), leading to the use of early radioactive sources for cancer therapy, though this was initially part of Radiotherapy.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1920s (Hevesy):</b> Chemist George de Hevesy pioneered the tracer principle—using small amounts of radioactive isotopes to trace chemical pathways—a cornerstone of Nuclear Medicine.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1934 (Curie-Joliot):</b> Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot discovered artificial radioactivity, demonstrating that stable elements could be made radioactive using accelerators. This was crucial for creating clinically useful isotopes.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. The Therapeutic and Diagnostic Birth (1940s)</h2>

    <p>The field matured during and after World War II with the availability of cyclotrons and reactors, allowing mass production of radionuclides.</p>

    <h3>The Isotope Era Begins</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1941 (Hertz/Hamilton):</b> Saul Hertz and Joseph Hamilton pioneered the therapeutic use of Iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I) to treat thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. This was the first true application of internal radiopharmaceutical therapy.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Post-WWII:</b> The U.S. government, through the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), made reactor-produced radioisotopes readily available for medical research, greatly accelerating development.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1950s (Brain and Liver Scanning):</b> Early diagnostic scans for brain tumors and liver metastases were developed using I-131 and Au-198 tracers, detected by simple counters.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. The Imaging Revolution (1950s – 1980s)</h2>

    <h3>A. The Gamma Camera</h3>
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>1957 (Anger):Hal Anger invented the Gamma Camera (also called the Anger Camera). This device could capture an entire organ's radiation distribution simultaneously, converting the early slow, point-by-point scanning into true imaging. This innovation is considered the turning point for modern Nuclear Medicine.</p>
        
    </div>

    <h3>B. Technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1960s:</b> The introduction of the <sup>99</sup>Mo / <sup>99m</sup>Tc generator system revolutionized the field. Technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) has ideal characteristics (short 6-hour half-life, pure gamma emission at 140 keV), making it the most commonly used medical isotope worldwide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. SPECT Imaging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1970s:</b> Development of Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). By rotating the Gamma Camera head around the patient, computer reconstruction allowed for 3D cross-sectional images, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy over 2D planar images.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Modern Functional Imaging (1980s – Present)</h2>

    <h3>Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1970s/1980s (Phelps/Ter-Pogossian):</b> Development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). PET uses positron-emitting isotopes (like F-18 and C-11) which are combined with biologically active molecules (e.g., FDG). When the positron annihilates, two 511 keV gamma rays are emitted back-to-back, allowing for superior image quality and quantification.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1990s (PET/CT):</b> The fusion of PET (functional data) and CT (anatomical data) in a single scanner became the standard of care, dramatically improving the diagnosis and staging of cancer.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Theranostics:</b> The latest evolution, combining specific radiopharmaceuticals for both diagnosis (THERA-py) and therapy (GNOSTICS). Examples include Lu-177 for PRRT (Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy) in neuroendocrine tumors.</li>
