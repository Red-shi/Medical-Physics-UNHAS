    <h1>💥 Direct & Indirect Ionization Physics</h1>
    <p>The two fundamental mechanisms by which radiation deposits energy in matter.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Ionizing radiation is any radiation with enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating ions. The way this energy is transferred to biological tissue determines the radiation's characteristics and clinical application. All radiation used in therapy and diagnostics can be categorized into two groups based on their primary method of energy transfer: Directly Ionizing Radiation and Indirectly Ionizing Radiation.</p>

    <h2>1. Directly Ionizing Radiation</h2>
    <p>This group consists of charged particles that interact directly with the atomic structure of the absorbing medium (tissue).</p>

    <h3>Mechanism: Coulombic Interaction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Process:</strong> Charged particles (like electrons, protons, alpha particles) possess an electric charge and interact continuously with the orbital electrons of the absorbing atoms via Coulomb force.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Transfer:</strong> The energy is transferred directly through two main processes:
            <ul>
                <li>Ionization: Removing an orbital electron, creating an ion pair.</li>
                <li>Excitation: Raising an orbital electron to a higher energy level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Path:</strong> They travel in relatively straight lines but undergo many small-angle deflections (scattering), especially electrons.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Deposition:</strong> Charged particles deposit a high amount of energy per unit path length, quantified by Linear Energy Transfer (LET). This leads to the phenomenon of the Bragg Peak for heavy charged particles like protons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Directly Ionizing Particles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Electrons (e.g., Beta particles, Linac electron beams):</strong> Lighter particles, exhibit more scattering and less pronounced Bragg peak. Used for shallow tumors.</li>
        <li><strong>Protons and Alpha Particles (Heavy Ions):</strong> Heavier particles, travel straighter and exhibit a sharp, well-defined Bragg peak, making them ideal for precise targeting (Hadron Therapy).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Indirectly Ionizing Radiation</h2>
    <p>This group consists of neutral particles (photons and neutrons) that must first transfer their energy to charged particles before ionization can occur.</p>

    <h3>Mechanism: Two-Step Process</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1 (Energy Transfer):</strong> The neutral particle interacts with the absorbing atom to release a high-speed secondary charged particle (an electron or proton). For photons, the main mechanisms are the Photoelectric Effect, Compton Scattering, and Pair Production. For neutrons, it involves nuclear reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 (Ionization):</strong> The newly released high-speed secondary charged particle then causes ionization and excitation, behaving exactly like a directly ionizing particle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Indirectly Ionizing Particles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photons (X-rays and Gamma rays):</strong> The most common form of radiation used in radiotherapy (Linacs). Their energy deposition (Dose) is entirely due to the secondary electrons they release.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutrons:</strong> Used in specialized neutron capture therapy. They release secondary protons or heavy ions via nuclear elastic and inelastic scattering.</li>
    </ul>
