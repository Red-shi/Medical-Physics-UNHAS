    <h1>🔍 Fundamentals of Imaging Physics</h1>
    <p>Exploring the physical principles behind medical image formation.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p><strong>Medical Imaging Physics</strong> is the branch of physics that studies the mechanisms by which internal anatomical structures and physiological functions are visualized. It is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning (e.g., in radiotherapy), and monitoring disease progression. Different imaging modalities exploit different physical interactions to generate contrast.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT)</h2>
           <img src="fig/Computed Tomography (CT).jpg" width="300" height="200"> 
    
    <p>These modalities rely on the differential attenuation of X-ray photons by different tissues.</p>

    <h3>The Physics of Attenuation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mechanism:</b> X-ray intensity is reduced as it passes through matter via Photoelectric Effect (dominant in bone/high-Z materials) and Compton Scattering (dominant in soft tissue).</li>
        <li><b>Contrast Source:</b> Tissues with higher physical density and atomic number (Z) (like bone) attenuate X-rays more strongly than low-density tissues (like air or fat).</li>
        <li><b>Radiography:</b> Produces a 2D projection image. The image intensity is a measure of the total attenuation along the X-ray path.</li>
        <li><b>Computed Tomography (CT):</b> Measures attenuation from multiple angles around the body and uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms (like the Filtered Back Projection) to reconstruct a 3D volume. The result is displayed in Hounsfield Units (HU), which are normalized measures of linear attenuation coefficients.
            <div class="key-concept">
                <p><strong>Hounsfield Unit (HU):</strong> A relative measure of electron density used in CT. By definition, HU of water is 0, and HU of air is -1000. Bone typically has HU > 1000.</p>
            </div>

    <h2>2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</h2>
       <img src="fig/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).jpg" width="350" height="200"> 

    <p>MRI exploits the quantum mechanical property of the nuclear spin of protons (Hydrogen nuclei) when placed in a strong magnetic field.</p>

    <h3>The Physics of Proton Spin</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Main Magnet (B<sub>0</sub>):</b> Creates a large, uniform static magnetic field, causing the protons (in water and fat) to align either parallel or anti-parallel to the field.</li>
        <li> The frequency at which the aligned protons precess (wobble). This frequency is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength: &omega; = &gamma B <sub>0</sub>, where &gamma; is the gyromagnetic ratio.</li>
        <li><b>Larmor Frequency (&omega;):</b>Radiofrequency (RF) Pulse: A pulse of RF energy tuned exactly to the Larmor frequency is transmitted. This "tips" the net magnetization vector into the transverse plane.</li>
        <li><b>Signal Detection:</b> When the RF pulse is turned off, the protons relax back to alignment, emitting RF energy (the signal) at the Larmor frequency.</li>
        <li><b>Contrast Source:</b> Contrast is determined by the relaxation times:
            <ul>
                <li>T <sub>1</sub> (Longitudinal Relaxation): Time for the longitudinal magnetization to recover.</li>
                <li>T<sub>1</sub> (Transverse Relaxation): Time for the transverse magnetization to decay.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ultrasound Imaging (US)</h2>
       <img src="fig/Mammography and Ultrasound.jpg" width="350" height="200"> 

    <p>Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves (typically 2-15 MHz) to create images based on reflection and scattering.</p>

    <h3>The Physics of Sound Waves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Transducer:</b> A device containing piezoelectric crystals that converts electrical energy into mechanical sound waves (transmit mode) and converts returning sound echoes back into electrical energy (receive mode).</li>
        <li><b>Acoustic Impedance (Z):</b> The key physical property that determines reflection. It is the product of the density of the medium (&rho;) and the speed of sound (c): Z = &rho; c.</li>
        <li><b>Reflection and Refraction:</b> When sound waves encounter a boundary between two tissues with different acoustic impedances, a portion of the wave is reflected back to the transducer (the echo), and the rest is transmitted/refracted.
            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>Doppler Effect:</strong> Used to measure blood flow. The frequency of the reflected sound wave changes if the reflector (e.g., red blood cells) is moving relative to the transducer. The change in frequency is proportional to the velocity of the blood flow.
            </div>

    <h2>4. Nuclear Medicine (PET and SPECT)</h2>
       <img src="fig/Gamma Camera & SPECT.png" width="350" height="200"> 
    <p>These modalities are unique because they image the distribution of an injected radioactive tracer to visualize function rather than just anatomy.</p>

    <h3>The Physics of Emission Imaging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Radiopharmaceuticals:</b> A molecule (like glucose or water) is labeled with a short-lived radioisotope (e.g., Fluorine-18 for PET, Technetium-99m for SPECT).</li>
        <li><b>SPECT (Single-Photon Emission CT):</b> Detects single gamma rays emitted directly by the decaying radioisotope. A collimator (lead grid) is used to ensure only gamma rays traveling perpendicularly hit the crystal detector.</li>
        <li><b>PET (Positron Emission Tomography):</b> Uses isotopes that emit a positron. The positron travels a short distance before annihilating with a nearby electron, producing two 511 keV gamma rays traveling in opposite directions (180° apart).
            <ul>
                <li>Coincidence Detection: PET scanners detect pairs of 511 keV photons arriving at detectors almost simultaneously. This coincidence defines a Line of Response (LOR), which is used to localize the annihilation event and reconstruct the 3D image.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding these fundamental physical principles is the starting point for working in medical imaging, whether in a diagnostic or therapeutic capacity.</p>
