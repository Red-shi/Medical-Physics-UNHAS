    <h1>📜 History of Radiation Protection Physics</h1>
    <p>From early discoveries to modern safety standards and dose limits.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>The history of Radiation Protection is a narrative of scientific discovery, initial enthusiasm, tragic realization of biological harm, and subsequent establishment of robust, physics-based safety standards. The core objective is to prevent deterministic effects (tissue damage) and reduce the probability of stochastic effects (cancer/genetic defects).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Early Days: Discovery and Unrecognized Danger (1895–1920)</h2>

    <div class="key-event">
        <p><span class="era">1895: X-ray Discovery</span> – Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovers X-rays. Within months, X-rays are used widely in medicine and even for entertainment, with no understanding of their biological effects.</p>
        <p><span class="era">1896: Radioactivity Discovery</span> – Henri Becquerel discovers radioactivity. Soon after, Pierre and Marie Curie isolate Radium. Early radiation exposure was massive; many scientists developed severe radiation burns and cancers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>First Signs of Harm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Early diagnostic radiologists often suffered severe skin burns and loss of hair.</li>
        <li>The lack of standardized dose units and reliable instrumentation meant radiation exposure was uncontrolled.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Establishment of Safety Standards and Units (1920–1950)</h2>
    <p>Recognizing the severity of injuries, the scientific community began forming official bodies to recommend safety guidelines.</p>

    <div class="key-event">
        <p><span class="era">1925: First International Congress of Radiology</span> – Calls for international agreement on dose measurement and protection standards.</p>
        <p><span class="era">1928: The Roentgen Unit</span> – The first internationally accepted unit for measuring Exposure (the amount of ionization in air) is adopted. This marked the start of quantitative radiation safety physics.</p>
        <p><span class="era">1928: ICRP Formation</span> – The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is officially established (originally IRPC). Its recommendations form the basis of nearly all national radiation safety legislation.</p>
        <p><span class="era">1934: Tolerance Dose</span> – The concept of a daily "tolerance dose" (based on no observable skin effect) is introduced, though it was still a large and biologically unsafe dose by modern standards.</p>
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Absorbed Dose (Gray): Later replaced the Roentgen as the fundamental dose unit for radiation protection and therapy. Defined in 1953.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Modern Dose Limits and the ALARA Principle (1950–Present)</h2>
    <p>The study of Atomic Bomb survivors and radiation workers led to a shift from "tolerance dose" (no deterministic effects) to a focus on preventing stochastic effects.</p>

    <h3>The ICRP System of Dose Limitation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Justification:</strong> Any practice involving radiation exposure must yield a net benefit to the exposed individual or society.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization (ALARA):</strong> All exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable, taking economic and social factors into account. This principle is the cornerstone of clinical medical physics safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Dose Limitation:</strong> Strict limits on individual doses (effective dose, equivalent dose) are set for workers and the public to prevent deterministic effects and minimize the probability of stochastic effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Modern Physics Concepts</h3>
    <div class="key-event">
        <p><strong>Equivalent Dose (H<sub>T</sub>):</strong> Accounts for the biological harm caused by different types of radiation (e.g., photons vs. neutrons) using a Radiation Weighting Factor (W <sub>R</sub>). Unit: Sievert (Sv).</p>
        <p class="formula">
            H<sub>T</sub> = &Sigma;<sub>R</sub> W<sub>R</sub> &middot; D<sub>T,R</sub>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Effective Dose (E):</strong> Accounts for the varying sensitivity of different organs and tissues using a Tissue Weighting Factor (W <sub>T</sub>). This allows a single value to represent the overall stochastic risk to the entire body. Unit: Sievert (Sv).</p>
        <p class="formula">
            E = &Sigma;<sub>T</sub> W<sub>T</sub> &middot; H<sub>T</sub>

        </p>
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Patient Protection: The focus in medical physics shifted from solely protecting the radiation worker to meticulous patient dose management, especially with high-dose procedures like CT and Interventional Radiology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The field of radiation protection continues to evolve, constantly refining dose limits and monitoring techniques based on updated radiobiological data and technological advancements, all guided by the fundamental principles laid out over the last century.</p>
