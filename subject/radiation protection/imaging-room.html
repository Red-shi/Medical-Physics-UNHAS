    <p>Physical requirements and safety considerations for medical imaging facilities.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>The design and construction of an Imaging Room are critical in medical physics. The room must not only support the optimal function of sophisticated equipment but, most importantly, must ensure radiation safety for patients, staff, and the public, aligning with the ALARA Principle.</p>
                <img src="fig/Imaging Room Physics and Design.jpeg" width="500" height="350">

    <h2>1. Universal Physical Requirements</h2>

    <h3>A. Structural Integrity and Space</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Floor Loading:</b> Floors must be able to support the high weight of the equipment (especially CT, MRI, and Linear Accelerators). For example, a 3 Tesla MRI system can weigh several tons.</li>
        <li><b>Dimensions:</b> The room size must allow for safe movement of the equipment and patient table, provide adequate operational clearances, and allow for emergency access.</li>
        <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Doors and hallways must be large enough to accommodate patient transfer and the installation/maintenance of large components.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Environmental Control</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Power and Electrical:</b> High, stable power supply is necessary (especially for CT and MRI). Reliable cooling systems (HVAC) are crucial to dissipate heat generated by X-ray tubes, magnets, and electronics.</li>
        <li><b>Ventilation:</b> For MRI, emergency ventilation is mandatory to safely vent the Helium gas in the event of a magnet quench.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Radiation Protection: Shielding Design</h2>
    <p>Shielding is the primary function of room design determined by the medical physicist's calculations.</p>

    <h3>Shielding Calculations </h3>
    <p>Shielding thickness is calculated based on three major factors to ensure dose limits are met in occupied areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Workload (W) The intensity and frequency of equipment use (e.g., total mAs per week for X-ray/CT).</li>
        <li>2. Use Factor (U): The fraction of time the radiation beam is aimed at a specific barrier (wall, floor, or ceiling). This applies mainly to the Primary Barrier.</li>
        <li>3. Occupancy Factor (T): The fraction of time the area outside the room is occupied (e.g., T=1 for adjacent offices; T=1/5 for a hallway).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <p><strong>Shielding Materials:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Diagnostic X-rays:</b> Primarily use Lead (Pb) shielding embedded in walls and doors. Thickness is calculated using the radiation's Half-Value Layer (HVL).</li>
            <li><b>High-Energy Radiation (Linacs/Cobalt):</b> Requires thick, high-density materials like Concrete to attenuate high-energy photons effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Barrier Classification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary Barrier:</b> Barriers that can be struck directly by the useful (primary) radiation beam. These require the thickest shielding.</li>
        <li><b>Secondary Barrier:</b> Barriers that are only exposed to scatter radiation (from the patient) and leakage radiation (from the tube head). These are typically thinner.</li>
        <li><b>Observation Window:</b> Must consist of lead-glass of an equivalent thickness to the adjacent wall shielding.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Modality-Specific Design Requirements</h2>

    <div class="modality-focus">
        <h3>A. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Room</h3>
        <p>MRI rooms require control of the magnetic field, not radiation shielding.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>RF Shielding (Faraday Cage):</b> The entire room (walls, floor, ceiling) must be encased in a highly conductive material, usually copper, to prevent external radiofrequency (RF) signals from interfering with the weak MRI signal.</li>
            <li><b>Magnetic Shielding (5 Gauss Line):</b> Steel (passive) or special coils (active shielding) are used to contain the strong static magnetic field. The 5 Gauss line must be contained within the controlled area, as it is the safety threshold for people with pacemakers.</li>
            <li><b>Quench Pipe:</b> A dedicated exhaust tube to safely vent super-cooled Helium gas outside the building during a magnet quench.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="modality-focus">
        <h3>B. Nuclear Medicine (PET/SPECT) Suite</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hot Lab:</b> A dedicated, heavily lead-shielded area for preparing, calibrating, and storing radiopharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li><b>Injection/Uptake Rooms:</b> Areas where patients are injected and wait for the tracer to distribute must be shielded (often concrete or thick lead barriers) to minimize exposure to other staff and patients from the patient's internal source.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-focus">
        <h3>C. CT & Interventional Radiology (IR) Rooms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>CT Shielding:</b> Requires shielding that accounts for $360^{\circ}$ rotation and high workloads. The control area is always shielded by lead-lined walls and observation glass.</li>
            <li><b>IR Rooms:</b>Often involve complex shielding for high cumulative doses (long fluoroscopy times). Floors and ceilings require careful calculation due to the beam being directed in multiple angles.</li>
        </ul>
