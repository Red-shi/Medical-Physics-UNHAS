    <h1>⚠️ Radiation Exposure: Sources and Classification</h1>
    <p>Understanding the pathways by which ionizing radiation reaches humans.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Radiation Exposure occurs when an individual is subjected to or comes into contact with a source of ionizing radiation, resulting in energy deposition within the body. Exposure can arise from both natural (which accounts for the majority) and man-made sources.</p>

    <h2>1. Main Classifications of Exposure Situations</h2>
    <p>The ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) classifies exposure into three main categories based on the circumstances under which the exposure occurs:</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>1. Planned Exposure Situation</h3>
        <p>Exposure resulting from the deliberate operation of authorized radiation sources, where dose estimates can be determined in advance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Examples</b> Operation of a Linac in a hospital, nuclear power facilities, or routine diagnostic X-ray use.</li>
            <li><b>Protection Goal:</b> Applying all three ICRP principles: Justification, Optimization (ALARA), and Dose Limits.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>2. Emergency Exposure Situation</h3>
        <p>A sudden, unexpected exposure situation, often requiring urgent action to mitigate serious consequences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Nuclear reactor accidents (like Chernobyl or Fukushima), or accidents during the transport of radioactive sources.</li>
            <li><b>Protection Goal:</b> Gaining control over the situation and reducing doses to acceptable levels.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>3. Existing Exposure Situation</h3>
        <p>Exposure that already exists and continues, where decisions must be made about whether and how to reduce it. This exposure is often unavoidable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Examples:</b> Exposure from Radon gas in homes, natural cosmic radiation.</li>
            <li><b>Protection Goal:</b> Control is typically managed through intervention (e.g., ventilation for Radon), rather than standard dose limits.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Major Sources of Radiation Exposure</h2>
    <p>The general population is exposed to radiation from a variety of sources, both natural and artificial.  This chart typically shows that natural background radiation is the largest contributor.</p>

    <h3>A. Natural Background Radiation</h3>
    <p>Accounts for approximately 80% of the total average dose received by the public.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>1. Cosmic:</strong> Radiation originating from outer space that penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Dose increases significantly at higher altitudes (e.g., during air travel).</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>2. Terrestrial:</strong> Radiation from naturally occurring radioisotopes within the Earth, such as Uranium (U), Thorium (Th), and Potassium-40 (K-40) found in rocks, soil, and building materials.</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>3. Internal:</strong> Radiation from naturally occurring isotopes incorporated into the body via food, water, and air (primarily K-40).</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>4. Radon Gas:</strong> A naturally occurring radioactive gas resulting from the decay of Uranium in the soil. Radon can accumulate indoors and is often the single largest source of natural exposure, especially to the lungs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Man-Made (Artificial) Radiation Sources</h3>
    <p>Accounts for the remaining portion of the total average dose.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>1. Medical Exposure:</strong> The largest artificial source. Includes diagnostic X-rays, CT scans, Nuclear Medicine (PET/SPECT), and Radiotherapy. Doses to patients are not subject to ICRP dose limits but must be optimized (ALARA).</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>2. Occupational Exposure:</strong> Exposure received by workers dealing with radiation sources (e.g., radiographers, medical physicists, nuclear facility workers). This exposure is subject to strict dose limits.</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>3. Industrial/Research:</strong> Use of radiation sources in industrial gauging, calibration, smoke detectors, and scientific research.</li>
        <li class="source-item"><strong>4. Fallout/Accidents:</strong> Residue from past nuclear weapons testing or reactor accidents (contributes a very small amount to the average global population dose).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Types of Exposure by Contact Method</h2>
    <p>Exposure is also classified based on how the radiation reaches the individual:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>External Exposure:</strong> Radiation that originates outside the body (e.g., X-rays from a machine, gamma rays from an industrial source). Controlled primarily through Time, Distance, and Shielding.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal Exposure:</strong> Exposure from radioactive substances that have entered the body through inhalation (e.g., Radon), ingestion (food/water), or injection (e.g., F-18 in PET). Controlled primarily by preventing the intake of radionuclides.</li>
    </ul>
