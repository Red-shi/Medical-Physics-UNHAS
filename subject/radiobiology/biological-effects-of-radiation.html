    <h1>🧬 Biological Effects of Radiation</h1>
    <p>Cellular and systemic responses to energy deposition by ionizing radiation.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Radiobiology studies the mechanisms by which living organisms and their components interact with and respond to ionizing radiation. The primary goal is to understand how absorbed energy leads to molecular damage, cellular death, and ultimately, clinical effects on tissues and organs.</p>
    

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Primary Target: Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</h2>

    <p>While radiation interacts with all molecules, DNA in the nucleus is considered the most critical target. Damage to DNA is most often responsible for cell death and genetic mutations.</p>

    <h3>A. Types of DNA Damage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Base Damage:</b> Alteration of a single base, often leading to miscoding.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Single-Strand Breaks (SSB):</b> Breakage of one phosphodiester backbone. Easily repaired, largely harmless on its own.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Double-Strand Breaks (DSB):</b> Breakage of both backbones near each other. This is the most lethal and critical lesion, as it often leads to chromosome aberrations and irreparable damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Molecular Response</h3>
    <p>Cells have sophisticated systems to detect and repair DNA damage. The outcome of radiation exposure depends heavily on the cell's ability to activate repair mechanisms or initiate programmed cell death (apoptosis).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Cellular Responses and Cell Death</h2>

    <p>The fate of an irradiated cell depends on the dose, the cell cycle stage at the time of irradiation, and the cell type's inherent radiosensitivity.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Mitotic Death (Reproductive Death):</b> The most common way cells are killed by radiation, particularly in rapidly dividing cells. The cell attempts to divide but dies during the division process due to irreparable chromosomal damage.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death):</b> A mode of cell death induced early by radiation, especially in lymphocytes and other highly sensitive cells. This is an active, orderly process.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Interphase Death:</b> Cell death that occurs before the cell attempts to enter mitosis. Requires very high doses and is typical of nerve or muscle cells.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Mitotic Delay:</b> A temporary halt in cell division, most often occurring at the G2 phase check point, allowing time for DNA repair before mitosis proceeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Classification of Radiation Effects in Tissues</h2>

    <p>Effects are categorized based on their dependency on dose and the probability of occurrence.</p>

    <h3>A. Deterministic (Non-Stochastic) Effects</h3>
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>Effects where the severity of the damage increases with dose, and there is a threshold dose below which the effect does not occur.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Predictable, dose-dependent severity, require high doses.</li>
            <li><b>Examples (Acute):</b> Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), skin burns (erythema), cataract formation, sterility.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Stochastic Effects</h3>
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>Effects where the probability of occurrence increases with dose, but the severity is independent of dose (it's an all-or-nothing effect).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Probabilistic, no definite threshold is assumed, severity is independent of the initiating dose.</li>
            <li><b>Examples (Late):</b> Cancer (Carcinogenesis), and Hereditary Effects (mutations passed to offspring).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Factors Affecting Biological Response (The 4 R's)</h2>

    <p>In radiotherapy, the overall effectiveness of fractionated dose delivery is governed by four key radiobiological principles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1. Repair:</b> The ability of normal, healthy cells to repair sub-lethal damage between fractions.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>2. Redistribution:</b> The movement of cells into more radiosensitive phases of the cell cycle (G2 and M) between fractions.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>3. Repopulation:</b> The increase in the number of cells in both tumors and normal tissues during the overall treatment time.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>4. Reoxygenation:</b> The re-establishment of oxygen supply in the tumor core, making hypoxic (radiation-resistant) cells more sensitive to subsequent fractions.</li>
    </ul>
