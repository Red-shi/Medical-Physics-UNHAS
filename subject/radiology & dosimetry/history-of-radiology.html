    <h1>📜 The History of Radiology</h1>
    <p>From accidental discovery to indispensable medical practice.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Radiology is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases. Its history is relatively short but marked by rapid technological and scientific advancement, fundamentally transforming medicine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The Discovery and Immediate Impact (1895–1900)</h2>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h3>The Birth of X-rays (November 8, 1895)</h3>
        <p>German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered an unknown ray produced when running electricity through a cathode ray tube (Crookes tube). He named them X-rays (X for unknown). The first human X-ray image was of his wife's hand.</p>
        
        <p>The discovery was immediately recognized as a scientific breakthrough and quickly adopted by physicians for viewing bone fractures and foreign objects, leading to the rapid birth of the specialty of Diagnostic Radiology.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Early Developments and Parallel Discoveries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1896 (Becquerel):</b> Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in uranium salts, paving the way for nuclear medicine.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1898 (Curie):</b> Marie and Pierre Curie isolated the highly radioactive elements Polonium and Radium, establishing the foundation for Radiotherapy.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>1901:</b> Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Early Radiotherapy and Safety Concerns (1900–1940)</h2>

    <h3>The Therapeutic and Tragic Eras</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Early Radiotherapy:</b> Radium sources were quickly used to treat skin lesions and tumors. This marked the beginning of Radiation Oncology (Therapeutic Radiology).</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Lack of Safety:</b> Early practitioners and patients were often exposed to high doses of radiation without protection. Radiologists used their own hands to test exposure settings, leading to severe, chronic injuries and cancer.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Dosimetry:</b> The realization of harm led to early efforts in dosimetry (measuring radiation dose) and the establishment of basic safety standards, though crude by modern measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. The Post-War Revolution (1945–1970)</h2>

    <p>Following World War II, advancements in physics and electronics spurred diversification in the field.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Nuclear Medicine:</b> The widespread availability of nuclear reactors allowed for the production of artificial radioisotopes (e.g., Iodine-131, Technetium-99m). These were used for diagnosis and therapy, leading to the establishment of **Nuclear Medicine** as a distinct sub-specialty.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Cobalt-60 Teletherapy:</b> High-energy external beam radiotherapy using a fixed Cobalt-60 source became the standard cancer treatment, replacing unreliable early X-ray tubes.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Ultrasound (US):</b> Diagnostic Ultrasound emerged, utilizing high-frequency sound waves rather than ionizing radiation, initially used heavily in obstetrics and cardiology.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. The Digital and Computational Era (1970–Present)</h2>

    <p>The invention of computers and digital technology defined the modern age of radiology.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Computed Tomography (CT - 1970s):</b> Developed by Godfrey Hounsfield and Allan Cormack (Nobel Prize, 1979), CT uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices), revolutionizing the visualization of soft tissues.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI - 1970s/1980s):</b> Based on the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) discovered by Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell (Nobel Prize, 1952). MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed soft-tissue images without ionizing radiation.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Digital Radiography:</b> The shift from film-based X-rays to digital detectors (Computed Radiography, CR, and Digital Radiography, DR) improved image quality, storage (PACS), and transfer.</li>
        <li class="section-item"><b>Image-Guided Therapy:</b> Modern CT, MRI, and US allow for high-precision Interventional Radiology (minimally invasive procedures) and advanced Radiation Oncology (IMRT, VMAT, and Particle Therapy).</li>
    </ul>
