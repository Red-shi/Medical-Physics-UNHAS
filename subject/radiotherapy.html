    <p>Radiotherapy, or Radiation Oncology, is a crucial medical discipline that utilizes ionizing radiation to treat malignant neoplasms (cancer) and occasionally benign diseases. As physics students, your understanding of fundamental physical principles is essential to mastering this field. The primary goal is to maximize tumor cell destruction while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue, achieving the highest possible therapeutic ratio.</p>

    <h2>Basic Principles of Ionizing Radiation</h2>
    <p>The effectiveness of radiotherapy relies on the interaction of high-energy radiation with matter, specifically the biological tissue of the patient.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ionizing Radiation:</strong> This includes electromagnetic radiation (like X-rays and gamma rays) and particulate radiation (like electrons, protons, and heavy ions). Ionizing radiation possesses sufficient energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating ions.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong>
        <br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indirectly Ionizing Radiation (Photons/Neutrons):</strong> These neutral particles deposit energy in a two-step process: first, they release charged particles (electrons/positrons from photons) in the medium; second, these charged particles cause ionization. X-rays and gamma rays are the most common in clinical practice.</li>
                <li><strong>Directly Ionizing Radiation (Charged Particles):</strong> These particles, like electrons or protons, deposit energy through direct Coulomb interactions with orbital electrons in the atoms of the medium.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Biological Damage:</strong> The ionization process leads to the formation of highly reactive free radicals, which primarily damage the cell's DNA. This damage, particularly to the reproductive capacity of the cell, is what ultimately leads to the death or inability of the tumor cell to proliferate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Physics Concepts in Radiotherapy</h2>
    <p>Several core concepts from physics are directly applied in radiation therapy:</p>
    
    <h3>Radiation Dosimetry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the determination of the amount of radiation energy absorbed per unit mass of a substance.</li>
        <li><strong>Absorbed Dose (<var>D</var>):</strong> The basic unit is the Gray (Gy), defined as 1 Joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of mass (1 Gy = 1 J/kg).</li>
        <li><strong>Inverse Square Law:</strong> The intensity of an x-ray or gamma ray beam is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the radiation source. This is critical for dose calculation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Photon Interactions with Matter</h3>
    <p>When high-energy photons travel through tissue, their intensity is attenuated (reduced) via three main mechanisms:</p>
        <img src="fig/Photon Interactions with Matter.jpg" width="500" height="300"> 

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photoelectric Effect:</strong> Dominant at lower photon energies (relevant in diagnostic imaging).</li>
        <li><strong>Compton Scattering:</strong> The most dominant interaction in the megavoltage energy range used for therapy.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair Production:</strong> Occurs at very high energies (above 1.022  MeV).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Radiation Production</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Accelerators (Linacs):</strong> The most common therapy equipment. They accelerate electrons to high energies, which then strike a tungsten target to produce high-energy X-rays via Bremsstrahlung. They can also be used to directly deliver electron beams. </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Types of Radiotherapy</h2>
    <p>The physical delivery of the radiation dose can be categorized into two main approaches:</p>
        <img src="fig/Types of Radiotherapy.jpg" width="400" height="600"> 

    <ol>
        <li><strong>External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT):</strong> Radiation is delivered from a source located outside the patient's body.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teletherapy:</strong> The source is far from the target. Modern systems use Linacs.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialized Techniques:</strong> Include Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and Stereotactic Radiosurgery/Radiotherapy (SRS/SBRT).</li>
                <li><strong>Hadron Therapy:</strong> Uses heavier charged particles like protons or carbon ions. Protons exhibit a sharp dose deposition curve known as the Bragg Peak.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brachytherapy:</strong> A radioactive source is placed temporarily or permanently <em>inside</em> or immediately next to the target area. This provides a very high dose to the tumor while the dose rapidly falls off outside the target due to the inverse square law.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Role of the Medical Physicist</h2>
    <p>Medical physicists are integral to the radiotherapy team. Their responsibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Treatment Planning:</strong> Using imaging (CT, MRI) and sophisticated software to calculate the optimal beam arrangement and dose distribution (Treatment Planning System - TPS).</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> Regularly testing and calibrating the treatment machines (Linacs, CT scanners) and dosimetry equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation Safety:</strong> Ensuring the safety of patients, staff, and the public.</li>
    </ul>
