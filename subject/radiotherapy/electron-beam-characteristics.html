    <h1>🔬 Electron Beam Characteristics in Radiotherapy Physics</h1>
    <p>Targeting shallow lesions with high precision using charged particles.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>Electron beams are charged particles used primarily to treat shallow-seated tumors (e.g., skin, chest wall, lymph nodes) and boost the dose to superficial tumor bed regions. Their key characteristic is their ability to deposit a uniform dose up to a certain depth and then exhibit a rapid, sharp dose fall-off, effectively sparing underlying critical structures.</p>

    <h2>Electron Beam Production and Shaping</h2>
        <img src="fig/Electron Beam Production and Shaping.jpg" width="400" height="300"> 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Production:</strong> In a Linac, the electron gun and accelerating waveguide are used, but the beam is not directed at a high-Z target. Instead, it bypasses the X-ray target and flattening filter.</li>
        <li><strong>Scattering Foil:</strong> The narrow electron beam must be widened to a clinically useful field size using a thin metal foil (scattering foil) placed in the beam path.</li>
        <li><strong>Collimation and Cones:</strong> Electron beams are strongly influenced by scattering in air and collimating material. Dedicated electron applicators (cones) are attached to the Linac head to define the field size and ensure a fixed distance to the patient (Source-to-Surface Distance - SSD).</li>
        <li><strong>Field Shaping:</strong> Unlike photons that use Multi-Leaf Collimators (MLC) near the source, electron beams are shaped using custom-cut cerrobend blocks placed near the patient surface to minimize the penumbra effect caused by scattering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Primary Characteristic: Depth Dose Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Percent Depth Dose (PDD) curve for electrons defines their clinical utility, which is fundamentally different from photons.</p>

    <h3>1. The Electron PDD Curve</h3>
            <img src="fig/The Electron PDD Curve.png" width="400" height="300"> 

    
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>The electron PDD curve is characterized by three main regions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Surface Dose:</strong> Typically higher than MV photons (up to 80-95% for lower energies) because the electrons are already charged particles and begin depositing energy immediately upon entering the skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Dose Plateau (Therapeutic Range, <b>R</b><sub>80</sub>):</strong> A relatively flat region where the dose is close to maximum, suitable for treating the tumor.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Fall-off (Practical Range, <b>R</b><sub>p</sub>):</strong> A sharp drop to zero dose, providing the definitive "cut-off" depth. This is the main advantage over photons.</li>
        </ol>
        
    </div>

    <h3>2. Range Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Depth of Maximum Dose (<b>D</b><sub>max</sub>):</strong> Occurs at a shallow depth (typically 0.5 to 2.0 cm) and is generally independent of field size.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Range, (<b>R</b><sub>p</sub>):</strong> The depth at which the dose drops to zero. This value is used to estimate the maximum penetration depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Therapeutic Range (<b>R</b><sub>90</sub> or <b>R</b><sub>80</sub>):</strong> The depth to which 90% or 80% of the maximum dose is delivered. <b>R</b><sub>80</sub> is commonly used to approximate the useful treatment depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Penetration Estimation:</strong> The approximate therapeutic range (<b>R</b><sub>80</sub>) and practical range (<b>R</b><sub>p</sub>) are directly related to the nominal electron energy (<b>E</b> in MeV):
            <div class="formula">
                <b>R</b><sub>80</sub> &asymp; <b>E</b>/3 cm &nbsp; | &nbsp; <b>R</b><sub>p</sub> &asymp; <b>E</b>/2 cm
            </div>
            *(Example: A 9 MeV beam has a useful range of approximately 3 cm.)*
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Physics of Electron Interaction and Scatter</h2>
    <p>Electron interactions are governed by Coulomb forces (repulsion/attraction), leading to significant scattering.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Ionization:</strong> As charged particles, electrons directly ionize atoms and excite molecules.</li>
        <li><strong>Bremsstrahlung Contamination:</strong> Although electrons are the intended particles, some electrons interact with the collimators or scattering foil, producing unwanted low-level X-ray (photon) contamination. This contamination contributes to the small, non-zero dose deep beyond the <b>R</b><sub>p</sub>.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Coulomb Scattering:</strong> Electrons undergo numerous small-angle deflections as they traverse the medium. This effect causes the beam to spread out, resulting in the characteristic wide penumbra at depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Heterogeneity Effects:</strong> Electron dosimetry is highly sensitive to inhomogeneities:
            <ul>
                <li>Air Cavities (e.g., Lung): Dose decreases distal to the air cavity.</li>
                <li>Bone/High Density Tissue: Dose decreases within the dense tissue but can increase distal to the bone due to the reduced penetration and subsequent scatter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="key-concept"><strong>Clinical Limitation:</strong> Due to significant scattering, electron beams lose their sharp dose fall-off and uniformity when treating curved surfaces or highly irregular tissue geometries. This requires careful planning and bolus application.</p>
