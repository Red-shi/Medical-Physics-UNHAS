    <h1>💡 Photon Beam Characteristics in Radiotherapy Physics</h1>
    <p>Understanding the properties of Megavoltage X-ray beams for clinical dosimetry.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <p>In External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT), Megavoltage (MV) X-rays (photons) are the workhorse. The clinical use and accurate dosimetry of these beams require a thorough understanding of their physical characteristics. These characteristics are measured by medical physicists during the commissioning of a Linear Accelerator (Linac) and are essential inputs for the Treatment Planning System (TPS).</p>
        <img src="fig/Percent Depth Dose (PDD).png" width="500" height="900"> 
    <hr>

    <h2>Primary Characteristics: Depth Dose Distribution</h2>
    <p>The distribution of dose as a function of depth in the patient is the single most important characteristic of a photon beam.</p>

    <h3>1. Percent Depth Dose (PDD)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> PDD is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the absorbed dose at any specific depth (<var>d</var>) to the absorbed dose at a fixed reference depth (usually the depth of maximum dose,  <b>D</b><sub>max</sub> ), along the central axis of the beam.</li>
        <li><strong>Formula:</strong>
            <div class="formula">
                <b>PDD</b>(d) = (Dose at depth d) / (Dose at D<sub>max</sub>) &times; 100%
            </div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dependence:</strong> PDD increases with increasing beam energy (higher MV), increasing field size, and increasing Source-to-Surface Distance (SSD).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Tissue Maximum Ratio (TMR) / Tissue Phantom Ratio (TPR)</h3>
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>TMR (and its modern equivalent, TPR) is used for dose calculations when the machine's rotation center (Isocenter) is the reference point (Isocentric Technique).</p>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> TMR is the ratio of the absorbed dose at a depth <b>d</b> in the phantom to the absorbed dose at the depth of <b>D</b><sub>max</sub>, both measured at the same distance from the source (Isocenter). Unlike PDD, TMR is essentially independent of the SSD, simplifying calculations for rotational therapy (VMAT, IMRT).</p>
    </div>
    

    <hr>

    <h2>Secondary Characteristics: Lateral Beam Properties</h2>
    <p>The profile of the dose across the beam defines how well the beam shape conforms to the target volume.</p>

    <h3>3. Beam Profile</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition: </strong> A plot of the absorbed dose across the beam, perpendicular to the central axis, at a specific depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Regions of the Profile:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Flatness: The uniformity of the dose in the central area of the beam (typically defined within 80% of the field width). Modern Linacs use a **flattening filter** to achieve a uniform dose profile.</li>
                <li>Symmetry: The dose distribution on one side of the central axis should mirror the other side. Asymmetry indicates a problem with the Linac's beam steering.</li>
                <li>Penumbra: The fuzzy region at the edge of the beam where the dose drops rapidly (usually defined between the 80% and 20% isodose lines). A sharp penumbra is desirable for conformal therapy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Output Factor (Output Measurement)</h3>
    <div class="key-concept">
        <p>The Output Factor <b>Scp</b> is a measure of the machine's ability to deliver dose. It links the monitor units (MU) set by the TPS to the actual dose delivered to the patient.</p>
        <p><strong>Total Output Factor</strong> is the product of two factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><b>S</b><sub>c</sub> (Collimator Scatter Factor):</strong> Accounts for changes in scatter radiation produced by the machine's head (collimator and jaws) as the field size changes.</li>
            <li><strong><b>S</b><sub>p</sub> (Phantom Scatter Factor):</strong> Accounts for changes in the dose due to scatter radiation produced within the patient/phantom as the field size changes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>Photon Beam Quality and Energy</h2>

    <p>The "quality" or effective energy of an MV beam is determined by the accelerating potential of the Linac (e.g., 6 MV, 10 MV, 18 MV) and is characterized by its ability to penetrate tissue.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nominal Energy:</strong> The peak energy of the electrons striking the target (e.g., 6 MeV electrons producing 6 MV X-rays).</li>
        <li><strong>Half-Value Layer (HVL):</strong> While mainly used for low-energy X-rays, the TMR/TPR or the depth of maximum dose (D<sub>max</sub>) are more commonly used in MV radiotherapy to specify beam quality. Higher energy means deeper penetration and higher D<sub>max</sub>.</li>
        <li><strong>Flattening Filter Free (FFF) Beams:</strong> Some modern Linacs remove the flattening filter. This results in:
            <ul>
                <li>Higher dose rate (faster treatment).</li>
                <li>Conical beam profile (forward-peaked).</li>
                <li>Reduced head scatter and softer energy spectrum.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
